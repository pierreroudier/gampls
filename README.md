# gampls

## Dependencies

```
install.packages(
 c(
  "inlabru",
  "gratia",
  "mgcv",
  "pls"
 )
)
```

## Installation

Note that `gampls` is not (yet) on CRAN.

You can install the development version of `gampls`using the `remotes` package:

```
remotes::install_github("pierreroudier/gampls")
```
